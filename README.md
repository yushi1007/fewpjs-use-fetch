## Introduction

When it comes to making engaging web sites, we often find ourselves needing to
send a lot of data (text, images, media, etc.) so that the page is exciting.

**But** browsers won't show anything until they've processed all the of that
data. As a result, they show nothing. The screen stays blank and users
experience "waiting."

Too much waiting means visitors will click away and never come back. Web users
expect sites to load quickly **and** to stay updated. Research shows that 40
percent of visitors to a website will leave if the site takes more than 3
seconds to load. Mobile users are even _less_ patient.

To solve this problem and help provide lots of other really great features, we
developed a technique called **_AJAX_**.

In AJAX we:

1. Deliver an initial, engaging page using HTML and CSS which browsers render
   _quickly_
2. _Then_ we use JavaScript to add more to the DOM, behind the scenes

AJAX relies on several technologies:

- Things called `Promise`s
- Things called `XMLHttpRequestObject`s
- A [serialization format][sf] called JSON for "JavaScript Object Notation"
- [asynchronous Input / Output][asyncIO]
- [the event loop][el]

Part of what makes AJAX complicated to learn is that to understand it
_thoroughly_, you need to understand _all_ these components. For the moment,
however, we're going to gloss over all these pieces in this lesson. It just so
happens that modern browsers have _abstracted_ all those components into a
single function called `fetch()`. While someone interviewing to be a front-end
developer will be expected to be able to explain all those components above
(which we _will_ cover later), while we're getting the hang of things, we're
going to simplify our task by using `fetch()`.

Let's learn to use `fetch()` to apply the AJAX technique: a way to load
additional data _after_ information is presented to the user.

## Explain How to Fetch Data with `fetch()`

The `fetch()` function retrieves data. It's a global _method_ on the `window`
object. That means you can use it simply by calling `fetch()` and passing in a
path to a resource as an argument. To use the data that is returned by the
`fetch()`, we need to chain on the `then()` method. We can see what this looks
like below:

```js
fetch("string representing a URL to a data source")
.then(function(response) {
  return response.json();
})
.then(function(json){
  // Use the data inside of `json` to do DOM manipulation
})
```

Now let's add some multi-line (`/*...*/`) comments (which JavaScript will
ignore) to describe what's happening:

```js
fetch("string representing a URL to a data source")
  /*
    Here we are calling `fetch()` and passing a URL to a data source as the
    argument. The function call returns an object that represents what the data
    source sent back. It does *not* return the actual content. (More about this
    later.)
  */

  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
  })

  /*
    Next, we call the then() method on the object that comes back from the
    `fetch()`. We capture the object into the `response` parameter so it can be
    passed as an argument into a callback function.
    
    Inside the callback function, we do whatever processing we need on the
    object, in this case, converting it into JSON using the built-in `json()`
    method. (Another commonly-used method is `text()`, which will convert the
    response into plain text.) Finally, we return the JSON-ified response. 
    
    Note that we *have to return* the content that we've gotten out of the
    response and converted to JSON in order to use the data in the next then()
    method call.

    This first callback function is usually only one line: returning the 
    content from the response after converting it into the format me need.
  */

  .then(function(json){
    // Use the data inside of `json` to do DOM manipulation
  })
  /*
    This time, the `then()` method is receiving the object that we returned
    from the first call to `then()` (our JSON-ified object, in this case). We
    capture the object in the parameter `json` and pass it into a second
    callback function, where we will write code to do DOM manipulation using
    the data from the fetch
  */
```

> **Top Tip:** As always, we can name the parameters being used in our callback
> functions anything we like, but most JavaScript developers use `response` and
> `json` by convention. Following the same naming convention is optional, but it
> will make your code more readable to other developers.

### Filling Out the Example

Let's fill out our base skeleton.

First, we'll provide a `String` argument to `fetch()`.  As it happens,
`http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json` will provide a list of the humans in
space. You can paste this URL into a browser tab and see that the data uses a
JSON structure.

JSON is a way to send a collection of data in the internet, formatted as a
`String`. It just so happens that this string is written in a way that would be
valid JavaScript syntax for an `Object` instance. Thus the name "JavaScript
Object Notation", or JSON ("jay-sawn"). Programmers find it very easy to think
about JavaScript `Object`s, so they often send "stringified" versions of
`Object`s as responses.

The `then()` takes a function. Here is where you tell JavaScript to ask the
network response to be turned into JSON.  When you first start using `fetch()`,
most of your first `then()`s are going have a callback function that looks like
this:

```js
function(response) {
  return response.json();
}
```

The final `then()` is when you actually get some JSON (the return from the first
`then()`) passed in. You can then do something with that JSON. The easiest
options are:

- `alert()` the JSON
- `console.log()` the JSON
- hand the JSON off to another function.

We'll go for the `console.log()` approach:

```js
function(json) {
  console.log(json)
}
```

> **STRETCH:** But you _should_ be able to imagine that you could do some DOM
> manipulation instead.

Here's a completed example:

```js
fetch('http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json')
.then(function(response) {
  console.log(response);
  return response.json();
})
.then(function(json) {
  console.log(json);
});
```

Let's perform a demonstration. Navigate to http://open-notify.org in an
**incognito** tab. We need to go incognito to make sure that none of your
browsing history intereferes with this experiment.

Open up DevTools and paste the following into the console:

```js
fetch('http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json')
.then(function(response) {
  return response.json();
}).then(function(json) {
  console.log(json);
  console.log(`Holy cow! There are ${json["number"]} humans in space.`);
});
```

You might notice in the DevTools console that this chained method call returned
a `Promise`. We'll cover that later.

## Working Around Backwards Compatibility Issues

As you can see, `fetch()` provides us with a short way to fetch and work with
resources. However, `fetch()` has only recently arrived in browsers. In older
code you might see `jquery.ajax` or `$.ajax` or an object called an
`XMLHttpRequestObject`. These are distractions at this point in your education.
After working with `fetch()` you'll be able to more easily integrate these
special topics.

## Identify Examples of the AJAX Technique on Popular Websites

The AJAX technique opens up a lot of uses!

* It allows us to pull in dynamic content. The same "framing" HTML page remains
  on screen for a cooking website. The recipe on display updates _without_ page
  load. This approach was pioneered by GMail whose nav area is swapped
  for mail content swiftly &mdash; thanks to AJAX.
* It allows us to get data from multiple sources. We could make a website that
  displays the current weather forecast and the current price of bitcoin side
  by side! This approach is used by most sites to render ads. Your content loads
  while JavaScript gets the ad to show and injects it into your page (sometimes
  AJAX can be used in a way that we don't _entirely_ like).

## Conclusion

Many pages use AJAX to provide users fast and engaging sites. It's certainly not
required in all sites. In fact, using it could be a step backward if simple HTML
would suffice. However, as sites have more and more material, the AJAX technique
is a great tool to have.

Using `fetch()`, we can include requests for data wherever we need to in
our code. We can `fetch()` data on the click of a button or the expansion of an
accordion display. There are many older methods for fetching data, but
`fetch()` is the future.
